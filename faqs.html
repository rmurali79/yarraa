<h3>I am a consumer. Do I have to create a new account for each item I register with Yarraa?</h3>
<p>No. Once you have created one account, you can manage all of your household items through it. This is what Yarraa's principle of "many products under one roof" is all about.</p>

<h3>Do I have to pay for my YARRAA account?</h3>
<p>No. YARRAA services are free for consumers.</p>

<h3>Can I create multiple users within my account?</h3>
<p>Yes. All family members in a household may create individual user IDs within a single account.</p>

<h3>Must all product information be entered at the same time or by the same person?</h3>
<p>No. You can enter new products as you purchase them, and you can enter your older products manually at any time you wish to do so. Anyone with a user ID for your account can do so, and any participating retailer can enter your new products into the system at the point of purchase.</p>

<h3>I buy household items from a variety of retailers and many different brand names. Can YARRAA keep track of all of them?</h3>
<p>Yes. Using YARRAA, you can easily keep track of all your household items, no matter who made them and where you bought them.</p>

<h3>Some of the stores where I shop have accounts with YARRAA, but others don't. Can I still use YARRAA with products I bought from the non-members?</h3>
<p>Yes, although you will have to enter the information on products from the non-member distributors yourself. Once this is done, YARRAA offers the exact same benefits as it does for products from member retailers.</p>

<h3>Some producers of products I have purchased send me information on new products through YARRAA. May I opt out of receiving this information?</h3>
<p>Yes. You may choose not to receive any product information from producers, and you may also choose to receive information from some producers and not from others.</p>

<h3>Will YARRAA share my contact information, purchase history, etc. with third parties?</h3>
<p>No. Your contact information will be available to producers of your favourite products only if you choose to make it available (for product promotions, etc.). As noted above, you can choose not to receive any information from producers if you wish. Your personal information will be used only for purposes of optimizing your account's suitability to your needs, and will be kept in strictest confidence.</p>

<h3>I sometimes buy from companies in other countries. Can I use YARRAA for purchases from overseas companies?</h3>
<p>YARRAA makes no distinction between domestic and international transactions. Use of the program is exactly the same regardless of where you and the companies you buy from are located.</p>

<h3>I just joined YARRAA, but many of the retailers where I shop are already members. What must I do to establish contact with them?</h3>
<p>You dont have to do anything. Next time you make a purchase at a participating retailer, the sales clerk will establish contact with you by scanning the purchase into the system and entering your e-mail address. You can even create a YARRAA account at that time if you do not already have one.</p>

<h3>How can I register products I bought before I joined YARRAA?</h3>
<p>Provided you have the purchase information (an invoice or receipt, a warranty certificate, etc.), you can simply copy that information manually into the system as you would with any online form.</p>

<h3>What if I forget my password or wish to change/reset it?</h3>
<p>To retrieve a forgotten password, simply click on "Forgot Password" on the login page. Your password will be sent to the e-mail address you supply. You can change your password by clicking on "Change Password" just after logging in. Just follow the instructions from there.</p>

<h3>How can I contact YARRAA staff for more personalized assistance?</h3>
<p>Visit our "Contact Us" page at http://www.yarraa.com. It contains more detailed information on how to reach us by e-mail, telephone or online chat.</p>

<h3>I am concerned about a possible breach of privacy in my account. What should I do next?</h3>
<p>Send a message to feedback@yarraa.com as soon as possible, explaining your problem and advising us on the best way to get in touch with you. Your concerns will be addressed promptly. Do not be alarmed if no visible changes appear on the website initially; this is a security procedure to avoid drawing attention to any possible breach until after it has been repaired.</p>

<h3>Does Yarraa store my financial information?</h3>
<p>No. In order to safeguard your financial security, we do not store your financial information.</p>

<h3>I carry many different brands of products at my store. Do I have to create a new account for each brand I register with YARRAA?</h3>
<p>No. Once you have created one account, you can manage all brands of items you carry with it. This is what YARRAA's principle of many products under one roof is all about.</p>

<h3>My store has many employees. Can I create multiple users within my account?</h3>
<p>Yes. All staff members within a store or office may create individual user IDs within a single account.</p>

<h3>Must all product information be entered at the same location or the same point in the sales process?</h3>
<p>No. If your business wishes to change the point of data entry, in terms of location (stockroom, sales floor, etc.) or time (earlier or later in the distribution/sales process), it can do so at any time with no interruption in services whatsoever.</p>

<h3>Our store employs sales clerks over different shifts, so they will not always be available to explain the details of a given case to each other. Can YARRAA help keep them informed of the details of purchases that were returned while they were not on duty?</h3>
<p>Yes. YARRAA can tell a clerk all he or she needs to know about when an item was purchased, when and why it was returned, who accepted the return, and the requested course of action (replacement, repair, etc.) without requiring any direct contact with other staffers who have been involved in the case. This facilitates quicker routing and eliminates the risk of communication breakdowns among the staff.</p>

<h3>We work with more than one distributor/service center/manufacturer for the same brand and/or product. Can YARRAA keep track of all of them?</h3>
<p>Yes. Using YARRAA, you can easily determine the exact route followed by every individual product you stock.</p>

<h3>Some of our manufacturers and distributors have accounts with YARRAA, but others don't. Can the we still use YARRAA with products from the non-members?</h3>
<p>Yes, although you will first have to enter the information on products from the non-member manufacturers and distributors manually. Once this is done, YARRAA offers the exact same benefits as it does for products from member manufacturers and distributors.</p>

<h3>I am a marketing director for a retailer. May I contact my consumers through YARRAA?</h3>
<p>Yes. You may send information such as product promotions and updates directly to consumers/end users of your products, with no third-party involvement.</p>

<h3>Will YARRAA share my contact information, purchase history, etc. with third parties?</h3>
<p>You can choose what information to make available to partners, and you may choose not to make certain types of information available if you wish. Your organization?s information will be used only for purposes of optimizing your account's suitability to your needs, and will be kept in strictest confidence.</p>

<h3>I sell to a lot of overseas consumers, and/or I work with a number of overseas distributors. Is YARRAA adaptable to international business?</h3>
<p>YARRAA makes no distinction between domestic and international transactions. Use of the program is exactly the same regardless of where you and your clients are located.</p>

<h3>I just joined YARRAA, but many of the manufacturers and distributors I work with are already members. What must I do to establish contact with them?</h3>
<p>Once you are registered with YARRAA, you are in contact with all other registered members. To become partners with a manufacturer, distributor or service center, all you have to do is select its name from the Non Partners List and click the Add As Partner button.</p>

<h3>How can I get information on products registered with YARRAA before I joined?</h3>
<p>You don't have to do anything. Once you register with YARRAA, you have access to all information contained in the system.</p>

<h3>What if I forget my password or wish to change/reset it?</h3>
